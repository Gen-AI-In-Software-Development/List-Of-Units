#  Unit27-Detecting-Security-Vulnerablities-In-Client-Server-Code

## Introduction

In this unit, we will ask Copilot to examine code for vulnerabilities.
These examples use Microsoft Copilot provided here: [Microsoft Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/).

## Use Case

Secure coding practices are essential to developing code that is resistant to attack.
In this unit, we provide source code to Copilot and ask it to evaluate the code's security.

The source code examples provided to Copilot have known vulnerabilities.

## Prompts and Code Critique

We will show each prompt that includes source code and show copilots response.  We will follow each example with a short critique and rating. The ratings will be Poor, Fair, or Good.

### Example 27.1 prompt:

### Generated Response:
