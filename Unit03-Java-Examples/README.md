# Unit03-Java-Examples
## Introduction
In this unit, we’ll explore various Java programming examples generated by Microsoft Copilot. Our goal is to review the code produced and provide constructive feedback.

These examples use Microsoft copilot provided here: [Microsoft copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/).

## Use Case
The prompts and code snippets presented here align with the level typically encountered in an introductory Java course or an introductory computer science course that utilizes Java.

## Prompts and Code Critique
We will show each prompt and the resulting code generated by Copilot. We will follow each example
with a short critique and rating. The ratings will be Poor, Fair, or Good.

### Example 3.1 prompt: Generate a class that encapsulates two real numbers named x and y. These numbers are going to be used to represent a point on the Euclidean plane.

### Generated Code
```
public class Point {
    private double x;
    private double y;

    public Point(double x, double y) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }

    public double getX() {
        return x;
    }

    public double getY() {
        return y;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Point(" + x + ", " + y + ")";
    }

    // Other methods (if needed) can be added here
}
```
### Critique
The class is properly named and capitalized (not a Java requirement but an important convention).
The variables x and y are correctly defined as private doubles. The private keyword is used to encapsulate
the variables - forcing a caller to use class methods to modify these variables. The keyword double is
appropriate because these will be points in the plane. A public constructor is provided that allows
the programmer to initialize the x and y values. Two public getter methods are provided so that a programmer can access the values of x and y by calling these methods. Finally, a toString() method is created so
that the point can be represented as a String. This method overrides the inherited toString() method.
Overall: This class is well done and readable. Rating: Good.

### Example 3.2 prompt: Please add comments to the code of the Point class.

### Generated Code:

```
public class Point {
    private double x; // The x-coordinate of the point
    private double y; // The y-coordinate of the point

    /**
     * Constructs a new Point with the given x and y coordinates.
     *
     * @param x The x-coordinate.
     * @param y The y-coordinate.
     */
    public Point(double x, double y) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }

    /**
     * Gets the x-coordinate of the point.
     *
     * @return The x-coordinate.
     */
    public double getX() {
        return x;
    }

    /**
     * Gets the y-coordinate of the point.
     *
     * @return The y-coordinate.
     */
    public double getY() {
        return y;
    }

    /**
     * Returns a string representation of the point.
     *
     * @return A string in the format "Point(x, y)".
     */
    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Point(" + x + ", " + y + ")";
    }
}
```
### Critique
The comments added to the code are in Javadoc format. This format is useful if you want to
generate API documentation. All of these comments seem appropriate. Overall: This class is
well done and readable. Rating: Good.

### Example 3.3 prompt: Please include functionality to compute the distance between two points.

### Generated Code:

```
    /**
     * Computes the Euclidean distance between this point and another point.
     *
     * @param otherPoint Another Point object.
     * @return The distance between the two points.
     */
    public double distanceTo(Point otherPoint) {
        double dx = this.x - otherPoint.getX();
        double dy = this.y - otherPoint.getY();
        return Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);
    }

```
### Critique
The code was included as a method of the Point class. It uses the Pythagorean theorem to compute the
distance from the current point to another point provided as an argument. Overall: This method is well done and readable. Rating: Good.

### Example 3.4 prompt: A word is said to be abecedarian if the letters in the word appear in alphabetical order. For example, the following are all six-letter English abecedarian words abdest, acknow, acorsy, adempt, adipsy, agnosy, befist, behint, beknow, bijoux, biopsy, cestuy, chintz, deflux, dehors, dehort, deinos, diluvy, dimpsy .Write a Java method that takes a word and returns whether the word is abecedarian .Take input from user.[1]

### Generated Code:
```
import java.util.Scanner;

public class AbecedarianChecker {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
      // Example usage
      Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
      System.out.print("Enter a word to check if it's abecedarian: ");
      String inputWord = scanner.nextLine();
      System.out.println("Is the word abecedarian? " + isAbecedarian(inputWord));
      scanner.close();
  }

  public static boolean isAbecedarian(String word) {
      for (int i = 0; i < word.length() - 1; i++) {
          if (word.charAt(i) > word.charAt(i + 1)) {
              return false;
          }
      }
      return true;
  }
}
```
### Critique
The solution presented does not take into account letter case. If the user enters
the string "Hello" the program will find the word to be "abecedarian". This is because
the capital letter "H" has a lower ASCII value (72) than the lower case letter "e" (101).
A better program would have converted the input to lower case before making the check.
Rating: poor.

### Example 3.5 prompt: Write a Java program that reads a 4-bit binary number from the keyboard as a string and then converts it into decimal. For example, if the input is 1100, the output should be 12. (Hint: Break the string into substrings and then convert each substring to a value for a single bit. If the bits are b0, b1, b2, and b3, the decimal equivalent is 8b0 + 4b1 + 2b2 + b3.). Take input from user.[2]

### Generated Code:
```
import java.util.Scanner;

public class BinaryToDecimal {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
      Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
      System.out.print("Enter a 4-bit binary number: ");
      String binaryString = scanner.next();

      // Ensure that only a 4-bit binary number is entered
      if (binaryString.length() != 4 || !binaryString.matches("[01]+")) {
          System.out.println("Invalid input. Please enter exactly four binary digits.");
          return;
      }

      int decimalValue = (Character.getNumericValue(binaryString.charAt(0)) * 8) +
                         (Character.getNumericValue(binaryString.charAt(1)) * 4) +
                         (Character.getNumericValue(binaryString.charAt(2)) * 2) +
                         Character.getNumericValue(binaryString.charAt(3));

      System.out.println("The decimal equivalent is: " + decimalValue);
  }
}

```

### Critique
The class BinaryToDecimal is appropriately named and follows Java naming conventions. The Scanner class is used to read user input, and input validation ensures that the input is a 4-bit binary number. For validation, two checks are performed. First, is the Java String of the proper length? If so, a regular expression is used to test each character in the String.

The method to convert the 4-bit binary number to its decimal equivalent is clear and correctly implemented.

The program provides clear and concise output, indicating the decimal equivalent of the binary number.

An improved version of this code would isolate the computation of the decimal value into its own method. It would also include documentation describing each section. Rating: Fair.  

### Example 3.6 prompt: The Harris-Benedict equation estimates the number of calories your body needs to maintain your weight if you do no exercise. This is called your basal metabolic rate, or BMR. The calories needed for a woman to maintain her weight is: BMR = 655 + (4.3 × weight in pounds) + (4.7 × height in inches) − (4.7× age in years) .The calories needed for a man to maintain his weight is: BMR = 66 + (6.3 × weight in pounds) + (12.9 × height in inches) − (6.8 × age in years).A typical chocolate bar will contain around 230 calories. Write a Java program that allows the user to input his or her weight in pounds, height in inches, and age in years. The program should then output the number of chocolate bars that should be consumed to maintain one’s weight for both a woman and a man of the input weight, height, and age.[3]

### Generated Code:
```
import java.util.Scanner;

public class ChocolateBarsCalculator {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

        // User inputs
        System.out.print("Enter your weight in pounds: ");
        double weight = input.nextDouble();

        System.out.print("Enter your height in inches: ");
        double height = input.nextDouble();

        System.out.print("Enter your age in years: ");
        int age = input.nextInt();

        // Calculations
        double bmrWomen = 655 + (4.3 * weight) + (4.7 * height) - (4.7 * age);
        double bmrMen = 66 + (6.3 * weight) + (12.9 * height) - (6.8 * age);

        int chocolateBarsWomen = calculateChocolateBars(bmrWomen);
        int chocolateBarsMen = calculateChocolateBars(bmrMen);

        // Output
        System.out.println("A woman of this weight, height, and age should consume "
                           + chocolateBarsWomen
                           + " chocolate bars to maintain her weight.");

        System.out.println("A man of this weight, height, and age should consume "
                           + chocolateBarsMen
                           + " chocolate bars to maintain his weight.");
    }

    private static int calculateChocolateBars(double bmr) {
        final int CALORIES_PER_CHOCOLATE_BAR = 230;
        return (int) Math.ceil(bmr / CALORIES_PER_CHOCOLATE_BAR);
    }
}

```
### Critique
The class ChocolateBarsCalculator is well-named, reflecting its purpose. The main method demonstrates its functionality effectively. The Scanner class is used to read user input, and the inputs for weight, height, and age are handled correctly. The BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate) calculations for both women and men are correctly implemented using appropriate formulas. The program provides clear and concise output, indicating the number of chocolate bars needed for women and men to maintain their weight. The calculateChocolateBars method is a good abstraction, encapsulating the logic for converting BMR to the number of chocolate bars.

The use of a constant identifier for CALORIES_PER_CHOCOLATE_BAR is well done and conforms to the Java convention of capitalizing constants.

There is no error checking in the code. The user may crash the program by entering string data.
Rating: Fair.


## Exercises
1. In Example 3.2, ask Copilot to generate comments for the Point class without using the Javadoc format. That is, you want comments but do not plan on generating API documentation.
2. In Example 3.3, Ask Copilot to generate the distanceTo method as a static method rather than a method of the Point class.
3. Provide Copilot with a modified prompt so that it improves on its solution to Example 3.4.
4. Request that copilot break out the decimalValue computation in Example 3.5 into its own method.
5. Request that copilot add error checking on user input in the ChocolateBarsCalculator of Example 3.6. The user should not be able to crash the program by entering bad data.
