# Unit03-Java-Examples
## Introduction
In this unit, we’ll explore various Java programming examples generated by Microsoft Copilot. Our goal is to review the code produced and provide constructive feedback.
## Use Case
The prompts and code snippets presented here align with the level typically encountered in introductory Java courses or computer science courses that use Java.
## Prompts and Code Critique
We’ll use several prompts and analyze their corresponding code generated by Copilot.

### Problem 3.1 prompt: Generate a class that encapsulates two real numbers named x and y. These numbers are going to be used to represent a point on the Euclidean plane.

### Generated Code
```
public class Point {
    private double x;
    private double y;

    public Point(double x, double y) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }

    public double getX() {
        return x;
    }

    public double getY() {
        return y;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Point(" + x + ", " + y + ")";
    }

    // Other methods (if needed) can be added here
}
```
### Critique
The class is properly named and capitalized (not a Java requirement but an important convention).
The variables x and y are correctly defined as private doubles. The private keyword is used to encapsulate
the variables - forcing a caller to use class methods to modify these variables. The keyword double is
appropriate because these will be points in the plane. A public constructor is provided that allows
the programmer to initialize the x and y values. Two public getter methods are provided so that a programmer can access the values of x and y by calling these methods. Finally, a toString() method is created so
that the point can be represented as a String. This method overrides the inherited toString() method.
Overall: This class is well done and readable. Rating: Good.

### Problem 3.2 prompt: Please add comments to the code of the Point class.

### Generated Code:

```
public class Point {
    private double x; // The x-coordinate of the point
    private double y; // The y-coordinate of the point

    /**
     * Constructs a new Point with the given x and y coordinates.
     *
     * @param x The x-coordinate.
     * @param y The y-coordinate.
     */
    public Point(double x, double y) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }

    /**
     * Gets the x-coordinate of the point.
     *
     * @return The x-coordinate.
     */
    public double getX() {
        return x;
    }

    /**
     * Gets the y-coordinate of the point.
     *
     * @return The y-coordinate.
     */
    public double getY() {
        return y;
    }

    /**
     * Returns a string representation of the point.
     *
     * @return A string in the format "Point(x, y)".
     */
    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Point(" + x + ", " + y + ")";
    }
}
```
### Critique
The comments added to the code are in Javadoc format. This format is useful if you want to
generate API documentation. All of these comments seem appropriate. Overall: This class is
well done and readable. Rating: Good.

### Problem 3.3 prompt: Please include functionality to compute the distance between two points.

### Generated Code:

```
    /**
     * Computes the Euclidean distance between this point and another point.
     *
     * @param otherPoint Another Point object.
     * @return The distance between the two points.
     */
    public double distanceTo(Point otherPoint) {
        double dx = this.x - otherPoint.getX();
        double dy = this.y - otherPoint.getY();
        return Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);
    }

```
### Critique
The code was included as a method of the Point class. It uses the Pythagorean theorem to compute the
distance from the current point to another point provided as an argument. Overall: This method is well done and readable. Rating: Good.

### Problem 3.4 prompt: A word is said to be abecedarian if the letters in the word appear in alphabetical order. For example, the following are all six-letter English abecedarian words abdest, acknow, acorsy, adempt, adipsy, agnosy, befist, behint, beknow, bijoux, biopsy, cestuy, chintz, deflux, dehors, dehort, deinos, diluvy, dimpsy .Write a Java method that takes a word and returns whether the word is abecedarian .Take input from user.

### Generated Code:
import java.util.Scanner;

public class AbecedarianChecker {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
      // Example usage
      Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
      System.out.print("Enter a word to check if it's abecedarian: ");
      String inputWord = scanner.nextLine();
      System.out.println("Is the word abecedarian? " + isAbecedarian(inputWord));
      scanner.close();
  }

  public static boolean isAbecedarian(String word) {
      for (int i = 0; i < word.length() - 1; i++) {
          if (word.charAt(i) > word.charAt(i + 1)) {
              return false;
          }
      }
      return true;
  }
}
### Critique
The solution presented does not take into account letter case. If the user enters
the string "Hello" the program will find the word to be "abecedarian". This is because
the capital letter "H" has a lower ASCII value (72) than the lower case letter "e" (101).
A better program would have converted the input to lower case before making the check.
Rating: poor.

## Exercises
1. In Problem 3.2, ask Copilot to generate comments for the Point class without using the Javadoc format. That is, you want comments but do not plan on generating API documentation.
2. In Problem 3.3, Ask Copilot to generate the distanceTo method as a static method rather than a method of the Point class.
3. Provide Copilot with a modified prompt so that it improves on its solution to Problem 3.4.
