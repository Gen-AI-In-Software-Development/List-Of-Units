#  Unit15-Designing-REST-APIs

## Introduction

These examples use Microsoft copilot provided here: [Microsoft copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/).

## Use Case

## Prompts and Code Critique
We will show each prompt and the resulting code or response generated by Copilot. We will follow each example
with a short critique and rating. The ratings will be Poor, Fair, or Good.

### Example 15.1 prompt: Please explain any architectural advantages of developing a REST API.

### Notes on Copilot response
```
Copilot cited each comment with web URLs. It mentioned the following advantages:
Interoperability
Flexibility of integrating with different types of systems (web and mobile)
Language independence from any particular programming language
Easy maintenance allowing easy updates due to modular nature of REST API's
REST APIs are stateless and client side state need not be maintained on the server which simplifies requests and responses
REST APIs are popular

```
### Critique
While essentially correct, the answer did not mention that REST APIs are textual, providing human readability. And if by "request" and "response" it means the request and response messages, there is an error. The request and response messages may be more complicated in a REST APIs than in an API where the server tracks application state.  Also, copilot did
not make clear what the distinction is between "interoperability" and "flexibility". Rating: Poor
