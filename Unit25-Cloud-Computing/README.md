# Unit-25-Cloud-Computing
## Introduction

In this unit, we will ask copilot to assist us in deploying a function to Microsoft Azure Functions.

## Use Case

Serverless computing involves the use of a server that is in the cloud and is managed by another party.
The user of a serverless computing platform is charged based on the resources used and is freed from having to administer the servers.

This use case involves the deployment and execution of a function to Microsoft's Azure Functions. Microsoft Azure Functions is a function as a service (FaaS) cloud platform.

Of course, there are other providers of FaaS. See for example Oracle Cloud Functions[1], Google Cloud Functions[2], and AWS Lambda [3].

## Prompts and Code Critique

We will show each prompt and the resulting response generated by Copilot. We will follow each example
with a short critique and a rating. The ratings will be Poor, Fair, or Good.

These examples use Microsoft copilot provided here: [Microsoft copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/).

### Example 2.1 prompt: I would like to write and deploy a simple Hello World service to Microsoft functions. I need step-by-step instructions. I am a student of this technology and so I do not want to pay a fee for the service or provide a credit card. I would like to write my service using Node.js.

### Generated Response:
```
Steps were provided but see the critique.
```

### Critique
A reasonable series of steps was provided, but when followed, the reader was asked to provide a credit card.
The prompt was clear that a credit card would not be used. So, I followed up with a new prompt. Rating: Poor


### Example 2.2 prompt: Azure asked for a credit card. I said that I was not willing to provide a credit card even though it is free. I need an educator's account.

### Generated Response:
```

Step 1: Sign Up for Azure for Students
Go to the Azure for Students page.
Click on “Activate now”.
Sign in with your school email address. This should be an email provided by your educational institution.
Fill in the required details and complete the sign-up process.

Step 2: Install Required Tools
Install Node.js: Download and install Node.js from the official website.
Install Azure Functions Core Tools: Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
npm install -g azure-functions-core-tools@4 --unsafe-perm true

Step 3: Create a Local Function Project
Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it:
mkdir myFunctionApp
cd myFunctionApp

Initialize a new Azure Functions project:
func init . --javascript

Create a new function:
func new

Select HTTP trigger when prompted.
Name your function HelloWorld.
Step 4: Write Your “Hello World” Function
Open the index.js file in the HelloWorld directory and replace its content with:
JavaScript

module.exports = async function (context, req) {
    context.log('JavaScript HTTP trigger function processed a request.');
    const name = (req.query.name || (req.body && req.body.name));
    const responseMessage = name
        ? "Hello, " + name + ". This HTTP triggered function executed successfully."
        : "Hello, World. This HTTP triggered function executed successfully.";
    context.res = {
        // status: 200, /* Defaults to 200 */
        body: responseMessage
    };
};
AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.
Step 5: Test Your Function Locally
Start the function app:
func start

Test your function: Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:7071/api/HelloWorld?name=Azure. You should see the message “Hello, Azure. This HTTP triggered function executed successfully.”
Step 6: Deploy to Azure
Sign in to Azure:
az login

Create a new Function App in Azure:
az functionapp create --resource-group myResourceGroup --consumption-plan-location eastus --runtime node --runtime-version 14 --functions-version 3 --name <your-function-app-name> --storage-account <your-storage-account-name>

Deploy your function:
func azure functionapp publish <your-function-app-name>

Step 7: Test Your Deployed Function
Get the function URL: After deployment, you can find the function URL in the Azure portal or by running:
az functionapp function show --resource-group myResourceGroup --name <your-function-app-name> --function-name HelloWorld --query "invokeUrlTemplate" --output tsv

Test your function: Open your browser and navigate to the URL you obtained, appending ?name=Azure to it.
This should help you get started without needing to provide a credit card. If you have any questions or run into any issues, feel free to ask!
```
### Critique
On the plus side, these directions took us to a web site that did not require a credit card. On the minus side, the directions do not work. No "index.js" was found in the directory and no directions were provided on how to navigate the directory structure that was created. Rating: poor.


## Exercises
1. Interact with copilot to create and deploy a "Hello World" function on Microsoft Azure. How would you rate this interaction? Poor, Fair, or Good?
2. Interact with copilot to create and deploy a "Hello World" function on AWS Lambda. How would you rate this interaction? Poor, Fair, or Good?
