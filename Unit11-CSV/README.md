#  Unit11-CSV

## Introduction

Comma separated values (CSV) files are plain text files containing tabular data.
Each line represents a row of the table and values are separated by commas.
These file types are quite common in industry and are often used for exporting and importing data between databases, spreadsheets, and other applications.

## Compelling Use Case
To increase our productivity, it would be nice if we had a tool that could generate code that provides simple access to such a file.

## Exercises
1. Ask Copilot to generate a sample file of 100 rows with fields that you describe. How would you rate Copilot's performance? Poor, Fair, or Good.
2. Using the data file from exercise 1, use Copilot to generate code (in the language of your choice) that makes it a simple matter for a developer to program against the file. How would you rate Copilot's performance? Poor, Fair, or Good.  
3. Given the following file, use Copilot to generate code (in the language of your choice) that provides a clean abstraction for a developer to use. [Crime data in Pittsburgh 1990-1999](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/mm6/95-771/CrimeData/CrimeLatLonXY1990.csv)
How would you rate Copilot's performance? Poor, Fair, or Good.  
4. Suppose we want to leave the the file where it currently is. That is, we do not want to download the file to our local machine but want to be able to use a URL to access the file, programatically. Have Copilot generate code (in the language of your choice) that computes some interesting statistics using the data in the file. How would you rate Copilot's performance? Poor, Fair, or Good.
