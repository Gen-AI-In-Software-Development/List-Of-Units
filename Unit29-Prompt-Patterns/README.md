#  Unit29-Prompt-Patterns

## Introduction

The prompts in this unit are motivated by the paper "A Prompt Pattern Catalog to Enhance Prompt Engineering with ChatGPT"[1]. The pattern names are from that paper and here, we provide example prompts and responses based on those patterns.

For a complete explanation of each pattern, the reader should consult the paper[1].

## Use Case

## Prompts and Code Critique

We will show each prompt and the resulting code or response generated by Copilot. We will follow each example with a short critique and rating. The ratings will be Poor, Fair, or Good.

### Example 26.1 Meta Language Creation Pattern prompt: From now on, whenever I use one of the capital letters from this list: A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H, I am referring to a vertex in an directed graph. When I use an ordered pair I am referring to an edge in the graph. For example, if I use (C,D) then I am referring to a directed edge in the graph that goes from C to D. When I use an ordered triple the third element of the triple is the weight on an edge. So, for example, the edge denoted by (C,D,5) goes from C to D with a weight of 5.

### Example 26.1.1 Given the following graph, is there a path from A to F? (A,B),(B,C),(C,E),(E,D),(D,F) ?

### Generated response

```
Yes, there is a path from A to F in the given graph. Here’s the sequence of vertices you would follow:

Start at A
Move to B (via edge (A,B))
Move to C (via edge (B,C))
Move to E (via edge (C,E))
Move to D (via edge (E,D))
Finally, move to F (via edge (D,F))
So, the path from A to F is: A → B → C → E → D → F.
```

### Critique: Copilot allowed us to introduce notation to describe a directed, weighted graph. It also correctly answered a simple question about the existence of a path and produced the path itself. Rating: Good.

### Example 26.2 The Output Automater Pattern prompt: I am performing the following steps using the command line on my MAC. I would like the steps to be properly placed in a batch file. I am using the bash shell and want to execute the steps with one command. The only command line parameter will be the name of the directory whose README.md has been modified. Every time I work on a README.md file in a directory, I do the following from just above that directory:

git add MyModifiedDirectory

git commit -m "Made improvements to my unit"

git fetch origin

git merge origin/master -m "Some good commit message here"

git push origin master

### Generated Code
```
#!/bin/bash

# Check if the directory name is provided
if [ -z "$1" ]; then
  echo "Usage: $0 <directory>"
  exit 1
fi

DIRECTORY=$1

# Navigate to the parent directory
cd "$(dirname "$DIRECTORY")"

# Perform the git operations
git add "$DIRECTORY"
git commit -m "Made improvements to my unit"
git fetch origin
git merge origin/master -m "Some good commit message here"
git push origin master

To use this script:

Save the script to a file named update_readme.sh.
Make the script executable by running chmod +x update_readme.sh.
Execute the script with the directory name as a parameter, like this: ./update_readme.sh MyModifiedDirectory.

```

## Exercises
1. Continue with Example 26.1 and ask Copilot to find the shortest path between two vertices in a graph. Use a larger graph than is shown in the example and include edge weights. Evaluate its performance as Poor, Fair, or Good.

2. Continue with Example 26.1 and ask Copilot to find the longest path between two vertices in a graph. Use a larger graph than is shown in the example and include edge weights. Note that the longest path problem is NP-Hard. Evaluate its performance as Poor, Fair, or Good.
