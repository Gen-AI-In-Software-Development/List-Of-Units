#  Unit09-HTML
## Introduction
In this unit, we’ll explore various HTML examples generated by Microsoft Copilot. Our goal is to review the code produced and provide constructive feedback to ensure best practices and effective usage of HTML elements and structures.

These examples use Microsoft copilot provided here: [Microsoft copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/).

## Use Case
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the foundational language for creating web pages and web applications. It defines the structure and layout of a webpage by using a variety of tags and attributes. HTML is not a programming language; it is a markup language that organizes content for the web.

HTML’s versatility makes it essential for web development, enabling the integration of text, images, multimedia, and interactive forms. It is also used in conjunction with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling and JavaScript for functionality, creating comprehensive and dynamic web experiences. Additionally, HTML plays a critical role in email templates, mobile app development through frameworks like Apache Cordova, and content management systems like WordPress and SharePoint.

In this unit, we will create various HTML examples and leverage Copilot to assist in demonstrating different HTML elements, attributes, and best practices.

## Prompts and Code Critique
We will show each prompt and the resulting code generated by Copilot. We will follow each example with a short critique and rating. The ratings will be Poor, Fair, or Good.


### Prompt 9.1 : Generate an HTML page that displays the scores of a bowling game for multiple players. Each player should have their scores for each frame displayed, along with a total score at the end. The layout should include a table with player names as rows and frames as columns, with the last column showing the total score for each player. Please include sample data for three players with ten frames each.Please generate code for all ten frames
