#  Unit21-C++-Examples
## Introduction
In this unit, we’ll explore various C++  programming examples generated by Microsoft Copilot. Our goal is to review the code produced and provide constructive feedback.

These examples use Microsoft copilot provided here: [Microsoft copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/).
## Use Case
The prompts and code snippets presented here align with the level typically encountered in an introductory C++ course or an introductory computer science course that utilizes C++.

## Prompts and Code Critique
We will show each prompt and the resulting code generated by Copilot. We will follow each example
with a short critique and rating. The ratings will be Poor, Fair, or Good.

### Example 3.1 prompt:  Write a C++ program that displays the text

### hello, world!

### on the user's screen.

### Generated Code
```
Sure, here’s a simple C++ program that will display “hello, world!” on the screen:

#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "hello, world!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}

When you run this program, it will print the text “hello, world!” to the console. The std::cout object represents the standard output stream in C++, and the << operator is used to send data to it. The std::endl manipulator is used to insert a newline character and flush the stream. The return 0; statement signifies that the program has executed successfully. If you’re using an IDE, you can simply paste this code into a new file and run it. If you’re using a command-line compiler like g++, you can save this code into a file (let’s say main.cpp), then compile and run it with the following commands:

g++ main.cpp -o main
./main
```
### Critique
A brief and correct C++ program that does as requested, with explanations of pieces of the code that might be confusing to a new C++ programmer.  The prompt was intentionally unsophisticated.  Rating: Good
### Example 3.2 prompt:  Revise the code to not use endl, and to make it unnecessary to repeat std:: for each C++ Standard Library facility.

### Generated Code
```
Sure, here’s the revised C++ program. I’ve used a newline character ("\n") instead of std::endl, and I’ve added a using namespace std; statement to avoid having to repeat std:: for each C++ Standard Library facility:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "hello, world!\n";
    return 0;
}

This program will have the same output as the previous one: it will print “hello, world!” to the console. The using namespace std; statement allows us to use names from the std namespace without qualifying them with std::. However, please note that using using namespace std; is generally discouraged in larger programs to avoid name clashes. It’s usually better to use the std:: prefix or to introduce specific names with a using declaration, like using std::cout;. But for a small program like this, it’s fine. If you’re using an IDE, you can simply paste this code into a new file and run it. If you’re using a command-line compiler like g++, you can save this code into a file (let’s say main.cpp), then compile and run it with the following commands:

g++ main.cpp -o main
./main
```
### Critique
Copilot makes correct revisions to the code based on the prompt, and explains why it made those revisions.  It also states an opinion about the  
using namespace std;  
line that is widespread but not universal.  Your humble reviewer suggests that if you create names that clash with C++ Standard Library names, you should change yours.
Rating: Good
### Example 3.3 prompt:  Write the shortest legal C++ program.

### Generated Code
```
Sure, the shortest legal C++ program is an empty main function. Here it is:

int main(){}

This program does nothing, but it’s a valid C++ program. It defines the main function, which is the entry point of the program, and this function returns an int. The body of the function is empty, denoted by the pair of curly braces {}. When you run this program, it will exit immediately and return 0 to the operating system, indicating successful execution. You can compile and run this program in the same way as the previous one. If you’re using a command-line compiler like g++, you can save this code into a file (let’s say main.cpp), then compile and run it with the following commands:

g++ main.cpp -o main
./main
```
### Critique
Copilot displays the exact correct shortest legal C++ program, and explains the code.  Very nice!
