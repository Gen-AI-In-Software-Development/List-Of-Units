#  Unit24-Theoretical-Computer Science

## Introduction

In this unit, we will ask copilot to generate some Turing machines and ask questions about theoretical computer science.

These examples use Microsoft copilot provided here: [Microsoft copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/).

## Use Case



## Prompts and Code Critique

We will show each prompt and the results generated by Copilot. We will follow each example with a short critique and rating. The ratings will be Poor, Fair, or Good.

### Example 24.1 prompt: I would like for you to work with Turing machines using the following notation. Sigma is the alphabet. Sigma = { '0', '1' }. delta is he transition function. Q is the set of states, for example, Q = { q0, q1, ..., qn}. I would like for you to build a 2 state Turing machine that writes as many ones as possible on an otherwise blank tape and then halts.

### Generated Response:
```
Sure! Let’s design a Turing machine with the given specifications. We’ll use the following notation:

Σ (Sigma): The alphabet, which is { ‘0’, ‘1’ }.
Q: The set of states, which will be { q0, q1, qH } where qH is the halting state.
δ (delta): The transition function.
Here’s the transition table for the Turing machine:

Current state   Read Sym  Write Sym   Move direction  Next state
q0              0         1           R               q0
q0              1         1           R               q0
q0              blank     blank       N               qh

The Turing machine will write '1’s on the tape until it encounters a blank symbol. Since the tape is initially blank and extends infinitely, the machine will continue writing '1’s indefinitely. Therefore, it will write an infinite number of '1’s before halting.

If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!
