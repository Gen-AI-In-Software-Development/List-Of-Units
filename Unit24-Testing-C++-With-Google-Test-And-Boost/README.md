#  Unit24-Theoretical-Computer Science

## Introduction

In this unit, we will ask copilot to generate some Turing machines and ask questions about theoretical computer science.

These examples use Microsoft copilot provided here: [Microsoft copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/).

## Use Case

The Busy Beaver is a famous problem in computer science[1]. The first few Busy Beavers are known. BB(0) = 0, BB(1) = 1, BB(2) = 4, BB(3) = 6, BB(4) = 13, 
BB(5) = 4098. In general, the BB(n) is incomputable. Note that BB(1) is actually a 2-state Turing machine. One of the states is the halt state and goes uncounted.

In this Example, we do not mention the term "Busy Beaver" but only ask copilot to solve the problem. See the exercises to go further.

## Prompts and Code Critique

We will show each prompt and the results generated by Copilot. We will follow each example with a short critique and rating. The ratings will be Poor, Fair, or Good.

### Example 24.1 prompt: I would like for you to build a Turing machine using the following notation. Sigma is the alphabet. Sigma = { '0', '1' }. delta is he transition function. Q is the set of states, for example, Q = { q0, q1, ..., qn}. I would like for you to build a 2 state Turing machine that writes as many ones as possible on an initial tape with an infinity of 0s and then halts. The first state will be the start state, q0, and the other state will be the halt state, q1. It is important to me that that the machine halts after writing as many ones as possible. I need the delta transitions.

### Generated Response:
```
Sure, I can help with that! Here’s a Turing machine that writes as many ones as possible on an initially blank tape (filled with 0s) and then halts.

Turing Machine Components
Alphabet (Σ): { ‘0’, ‘1’ }
States (Q): { q0, q1 }
Start State: q0
Halt State: q1
Transition Function (δ)
The transition function δ can be defined as follows:

δ(q0, ‘0’) = (q0, ‘1’, R): In state q0, if the machine reads a ‘0’, it writes a ‘1’, moves right, and stays in state q0.
δ(q0, ‘1’) = (q0, ‘1’, R): In state q0, if the machine reads a ‘1’, it writes a ‘1’, moves right, and stays in state q0.
δ(q0, ‘B’) = (q1, ‘B’, N): In state q0, if the machine reads a blank (B), it transitions to the halt state q1 and does not move the tape head.
Explanation
The machine starts in state q0.
It writes ‘1’ over every ‘0’ it encounters and moves to the right.
When it encounters a blank (B), it transitions to the halt state q1 and stops.
This Turing machine will continue writing '1’s until it reaches the end of the tape, ensuring it writes as many ones as possible before halting.

If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
```

### Critique
The proposed solution does not work as specified. The initial tape has an infinity of 0s and so, there will never be a blank encountered. The machine will never halt. Rating:Poor

## Exercises
1. See if you can get CoPilot to generate a few Busy Beaver results.
2. Does mentioning the term "Busy Beaver" improve on copilot's performance?
