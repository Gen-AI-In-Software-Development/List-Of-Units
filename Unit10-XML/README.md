# Unit10-XML
## Introduction


These examples use Microsoft copilot provided here: [Microsoft copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/).

## Use Case

XML (Extensible Markup Language) is a metalanguage allowing us to create new languages[1]. In fact, a large number of these formal languages exist today. HTML is an XML language and is quite popular for displaying data on a browser. Apache Maven and Apache Ant are popular build tools that describe software builds using XML. The Android platform uses an XML language to describe screen layouts and
the KML language is used to plot points on a map using Google maps. The list of XML applications is extensive.

In this unit, we will create our own simple language (Gradebook.xml) and ask copilot to help
us describe Gradebook.xml with a grammar and process XML documents using Java.

## Prompts and Code Critique

We will show each prompt and the resulting code generated by Copilot. We will follow each example
with a short critique and rating. The ratings will be Poor, Fair, or Good.

### Example 3.1 prompt: I would like an example XML document that holds a grade book. I plan on having no more than 5 students but each of the students will have several exam scores. Please show me an example XML document.

### Generated XML
```
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<class>
    <student>
        <name>Sam</name>
        <grade>76</grade>
    </student>
    <student>
        <name>Joe</name>
        <grade>80</grade>
    </student>
    <student>
        <name>Linda</name>
        <grade>82</grade>
    </student>
    <student>
        <name>Eugene</name>
        <grade>90</grade>
    </student>
    <student>
        <name>Tina</name>
        <grade>92</grade>
    </student>
</class>

```
### Critique
The solution shows five students but does not show any particular student with more than one grade.
The user does have a nice structure to work with. Rating: Fair.

### Example 3.2 prompt: I would like an example XML document that holds a grade book. I plan on having no more than 5 students but each of the students will have several exam scores. Please show me a document type definition, DTD, for such a structure.

### Generated Document Type Definition
```
<!DOCTYPE gradebook [
    <!ELEMENT gradebook (student*)>
    <!ELEMENT student (name, exam+)>
    <!ELEMENT name (#PCDATA)>
    <!ELEMENT exam (#PCDATA)>
]>


```
### Critique
The solution shows a document type definition whose outer element is gradebook. The gradebook
element may have 0 or more students. Each student has a name and one or more exam scores. The name
and exam elements may contain text for the name and text for the score. Rating: Good.

### Example 3.3 prompt: Continuing with our discussion, I would like the DTD to be included in the example XML document.

### Generated Document that includes a DTD:
```
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE gradebook [
    <!ELEMENT gradebook (student*)>
    <!ELEMENT student (name, exam+)>
    <!ELEMENT name (#PCDATA)>
    <!ELEMENT exam (#PCDATA)>
]>
<gradebook>
    <student>
        <name>Sam</name>
        <exam>76</exam>
        <exam>82</exam>
    </student>
    <student>
        <name>Joe</name>
        <exam>80</exam>
        <exam>88</exam>
    </student>
    <!-- Add more students here -->
</gradebook>

```
### Critique
The solution shows a document type definition (DTD) embedded in an XML document. This
is the correct way to do the embedding and the XML document is valid with respect to its grammar
(as specified in the DTD). Rating: Good.

### Example 3.4 prompt: Continuing with our discussion, I would like a Java class that wraps this grade book document. I want a method to read an entire XML document instance into a Java document object. I also want a method that writes such a Java document instance to a file passed as a parameter.  

### Generated Java Code
```
import org.w3c.dom.*;
import javax.xml.parsers.*;
import java.io.*;
import org.xml.sax.*;

public class GradebookParser {

    public static Document readGradebookFromFile(String filePath) {
        try {
            DocumentBuilderFactory factory = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();
            DocumentBuilder builder = factory.newDocumentBuilder();
            return builder.parse(new File(filePath));
        } catch (ParserConfigurationException | SAXException | IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
            return null;
        }
    }

    public static void writeGradebookToFile(Document gradebook, String filePath) {
        try {
            TransformerFactory transformerFactory = TransformerFactory.newInstance();
            Transformer transformer = transformerFactory.newTransformer();
            DOMSource source = new DOMSource(gradebook);
            StreamResult result = new StreamResult(new File(filePath));
            transformer.transform(source, result);
        } catch (TransformerException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Example usage:
        Document gradebook = readGradebookFromFile("gradebook.xml");
        if (gradebook != null) {
            writeGradebookToFile(gradebook, "output_gradebook.xml");
            System.out.println("Gradebook written to output_gradebook.xml");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Error reading gradebook from file.");
        }
    }
}

```
### Critique

This program will read an XML document and then write that same document to a file. The only
error is that there are several missing import statements:
```
import javax.xml.transform.Transformer;
import javax.xml.transform.TransformerException;
import javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory;
import javax.xml.transform.dom.DOMSource;
import javax.xml.transform.stream.StreamResult;
```
After the imports were included, the program compiled and ran correctly. Rating: Good.


### Example 3.5 prompt: Continuing with our discussion, I would like GradeBook to be a separate Java class that has the same structure as the XML grade book. I would like to be able to create an empty GradeBook object, populate it with values, and write the object in XML markup to a file. In addition, I would like to be able to read the grade book XML into an object of class GradeBook.

### Generated Java Code
```
import org.w3c.dom.*;
import javax.xml.parsers.*;
import java.io.*;
import org.xml.sax.*;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class GradeBook {

    public static GradeBook fromXml(Document doc) {
        GradeBook gradeBook = new GradeBook();

    public List<Integer> getExamScores() {
        return examScores;
    }
}

```
### Critique

The main routine creates an empty Java grade book object and populates it with data. It then
creates and internal XML document with the call to gradeBook.toXml(). It uses the previously created
GradebookParser to serialize the grade book to a file.

The output of this program is the following file:
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
<gradebook>
    <student>
        <name>Sam</name>
        <exam>76</exam>
        <exam>82</exam>
    </student>
    <student>
        <name>Joe</name>
        <exam>80</exam>
        <exam>88</exam>
    </student>
    <!-- Add more students here -->
</gradebook>
```

## Exercises
1. Using copilot, create a Java program that reads a grade book file in XML and adds 10% to each student's score. There should be an output file (in XML) holding the new grade book. Be sure to test your solution and give copilot a rating of poor, fair, or good.
2. Using copilot, create a Java program that reads a grade book in XML and allows a user (working at the terminal) to modify scores as they are presented. A new grade book, with the updated scores, will be generated. Be sure to test your solution and give copilot a rating of poor, fair, or good.
3. Using copilot, replace the Document Type Definition (DTD) for gradebook.xml with an XML Schema Definition Language (XSDL) grammar.
4. Ask copilot why XSDL may be preferable to DTD's.
5. Find an example XML file on the web and ask copilot to generate code (in Python or Java) that allows you to interact with the document on some way.
6. Ask copilot why a message marked up with XML may be better than a binary message. Rate the response from copilot as Poor, Fair, or Good. Ask copilot why a message marked up in binary may be better than the same message marked up in XML. Rate the response from copilot as Poor, Fair, or Good.
7. Ask copilot to compare and contrast XML messages with JSON messages. Rate the response from copilot as Poor, Fair, or Good.
8. Give copilot the entire file that you are currently reading and ask it to build a similar file but one that uses JSON rather than XML. Rate the response from copilot as Poor, Fair, or Good.
