## Introduction


These examples use Microsoft copilot provided here: [Microsoft copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/).

## Use Case

## Prompts and Code Critique
We will show each prompt and the resulting code generated by Copilot. We will follow each example
with a short critique and rating. The ratings will be Poor, Fair, or Good.

### Example 3.1 prompt: Generate a class that encapsulates two real numbers named x and y. These numbers are going to be used to represent a point on the Euclidean plane.

### Generated Code
```
public class Point {
    private double x;
    private double y;

    public Point(double x, double y) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }

    public double getX() {
        return x;
    }

    public double getY() {
        return y;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Point(" + x + ", " + y + ")";
    }

    // Other methods (if needed) can be added here
}
```
### Critique
The class is properly named and capitalized (not a Java requirement but an important convention).
The variables x and y are correctly defined as private doubles. The private keyword is used to encapsulate
the variables - forcing a caller to use class methods to modify these variables. The keyword double is
appropriate because these will be points in the plane. A public constructor is provided that allows
the programmer to initialize the x and y values. Two public getter methods are provided so that a programmer can access the values of x and y by calling these methods. Finally, a toString() method is created so
that the point can be represented as a String. This method overrides the inherited toString() method.
Overall: This class is well done and readable. Rating: Good.



## Exercises
1. In Example 3.2, ask Copilot to generate comments for the Point class without using the Javadoc format. That is, you want comments but do not plan on generating API documentation.
